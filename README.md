## 🚀 About the Project

This portfolio showcases some of my projects, technical skills, and background in web development and software engineering. It’s designed to reflect my personality, attention to detail, and preference for clean, maintainable code.

### ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS  
- **State Management:** Nested props (intentionally used to highlight component composition skills)  
- **Routing:** React Router  
- **Deployment:** Vercel / Netlify (depending on version)

> **Note:** I’m aware of alternatives like `useContext`, but for this project, I opted to use **nested props intentionally** to keep state flow explicit and demonstrate compositional clarity.
